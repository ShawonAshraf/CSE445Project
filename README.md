# Style Transfer using CNN and VGG16 Architecture
#### Course project for CSE445 Introduction to Machine Learning
#### Summer 2017, North South University

#### Dependencies

- `python3`
- `scipy`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow` / `tensorflow-gpu`
- `pillow`
- `numpy`


#### Usage

- You can run using the accompanying IPython notebooks in [Work/notebook]() folder
- Or you can run [Work/py_scripts/style_transfer.py]() like

```bash
python style_transfer.py path/to/style/image path/to/content/image
